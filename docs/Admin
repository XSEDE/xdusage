xdusage admins documentation:

In order to see how xdusage behaves for any particular user, xdusage allows
designating certain users as admin users.  This is accomplished by adding 
the following line to xdusage.conf:
      admin_name <user>
Multiple admin_name lines may be speficied for multiple admin users.
      admin_name <user2>
      admin_name <user3>
      ...

Admin users can impersonate other users by setting the $USER environment variable before running an xdusage command.

For exmaple, suppose regular user 'mshapiro' wants to see all the usage for accounts for 'navarro' on all of mshapiro's projects. This command would do it:

    xdusage -u navarro

Now suppose that mshapiro doesn't understand why xdusage reports what it does. Someone who is an admin on that resource can emulate being mshapiro by setting USER=mshapiro and running xdusage:

    env USER=mshapiro xdusage -u navarro

The admin can also diagnose the results by running

    env USER=mshapiro xdusage

to see all the projects that mshapiro is on, to see if there are some projects that navarro is not on, etc.

NOTES:

If the user running xdusage is not listed as an admin in xdusage.conf, xdusage will ignore the $USER setting.
Also, setting the USER environment variable is distinctly different from using the -u option to xdusage.
