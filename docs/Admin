xdusage admins documentation:

The purpose of defining administrator accounts in 

      <install dir>/xdusage.admins

is to allow admins the ability to run xdusage emulating a given user, in order to see how xdusage behaves for any particular user.

This is accomplished by setting the $USER environment variable before the admin runs an xdusage command.

For exmaple, suppose regular user 'mshapiro' wants to see all the usage for accounts for 'navarro' on all of mshapiro's projects. This command would do it:

    xdusage -u navarro

Now suppose that mshapiro doesn't understand why xdusage reports what it does. Someone who is an admin on that resource can emulate being mshapiro by setting USER=mshapiro and running xdusage:

    env USER=mshapiro xdusage -u navarro

The admin can also diagnose the results by running

    env USER=mshapiro xdusage

to see all the projects that mshapiro is on, to see if there are some projects that navarro is not on, etc.

NOTES:

If the user running xdusage is not listed in xdusage.admins, xdusage will ignore the $USER setting.
Also, setting the USER environment variable is distinctly different from using the -u option to xdusage.
