** xdusage-%VER%-%REL% Install Instructions
**********************************************

Instructions for installing xdusage from RPM (recommended) or from TAR.

To install xdusage on machines that are part of multiple XSEDE resources
please first review the following Advanced Integration Options document:

https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/99081/XSEDE_SP_Advanced_Integration_Options.pdf

**********************
** RPM Installation **
**********************

R1) Configure trust in the XSEDE-Production repository

   a) Browse the following directory and copy the link to the package that matches your operating system:
      https://software.xsede.org/production/repo/repos/

   b) Install the package at the link you copied above:
      rpm -i https://software.xsede.org/production/repo/repos/XSEDE-Production-config.<OPERATING SYSTEM>.noarch.rpm

   You may see a warning like this:
      warning: XSEDE-Production-config.centos-5-1.noarch.rpm: Header V3 DSA signature: NOKEY, key ID 20423dbb

   This is a signature trust bootstrapping issue because until you complete this entire procedure, RPM doesn't trust the signer of this RPM.

   c) Lastly, configure RPM to trust XSEDE's signature (PGP key) installed in the previous step:
      rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-XSEDE-Production

   SECURITY NOTE:
   If you need greater security assurance modify the above procedure as follows:
   a') Browse the package directory using https and review the server's HTTPS/TLS host certificate
   b') Download the package over https using your favorite secure download tool
   c') Verify the RPM before you install it using "rpm -Kv <package>"

   DEVELOPMENT REPO NOTE: If you are installing XSEDE-Development repository packages, follow this procedure:
      https://software.xsede.org/development/repo/repoconfig.txt

R2) Install xdusage

   NOTE: This package automatically creates an "xdusage" account that owns the files and will
         execute xdusage via sudo.

   Install via rpm/yum these pre-requisites:
   - sudo
   - xsede-ca-certificates

   To install to the default location “/usr/local/xdusage-%VER%-%REL%” use these commands:
   # yum install xdusage

   To install to a different location, say “/soft/xdusage-%VER%-%REL%”, use these commands:
   # yum install yum-downloadonly
   # yum update xdusage -y --downloadonly --downloaddir=./
   # rpm -i --prefix=<INSTALL_DIR> ./xdusage-%VER%%REL%-1.noarch.rpm


R3) Create the xdusage.conf file. The xdusage script looks for it in the following ordered locations:
      /etc/xdusage.conf
      /var/secrets/xdusage.conf
      <INSTALL_DIR>/etc/xdusage.conf

   This file will contain secrets, so should NOT have world-readable permissions.
   We suggest mode 0640 with owned:group set to root:xdusage.
   Examine the example file <INSTALL_DIR>/etc/xdusage.conf.example for further guidance.
   This example file may be used with minor editing.

R4) An API key needs to be generated and configured in the xdusage.conf file. A hash of that API key also needs to be
    configured into the API that xdusage will call. Instructions for generating the API key and hash and for getting the
    hash configured in the API are at https://xsede-xdcdb-api.xsede.org/.

    A resource_name and api_id also needs to be configured in the xdusage.conf file. The resource_name is used by xdusage
    to map usernames to people in the XDCDB. The api_id (along with the api_key) are used to authenticate xdusage to the
    API. Both of these values should be the same and must match the XDCDB Resource Name as listed at:
    https://info1.dyn.xsede.org/wh1/warehouse-views/v1/resources-xdcdb-active/
    
    An example xdusage.conf file with the information needed by the API:
      resource_name     = ranger.tacc.teragrid
      rest_url_base     = https://xsede-xdcdb-api.xsede.org/
      api_id            = ranger.tacc.teragrid
      api_key           = abcdgzCvPliUd2Hxa2k6Z3KCQzbgs8uSzjQpn2O4+62mEO9aEDTYJqcRhktODxyz
      admin_name        = mshapiro

R5) Edit /etc/sudoers to grant permission for everyone to run xdusage as the non_root user "xdusage" (created when the rpm was installed).
    This can be done by adding these lines:

      Defaults!<INSTALL_DIR>/bin/xdusage env_keep="USER"
      Defaults!<INSTALL_DIR>/bin/xdusage runas_default=xdusage
      ALL ALL=(xdusage) NOPASSWD: <INSTALL_DIR>/bin/xdusage

R6) Install an xdusage modules file to make it easier for users to access it. Copy the sample file in
    <INSTALL_DIR>/etc/xdusage.modules.example to /usr/local/Modules/modulefiles/xdusage/%VER%-%REL%
    (or a Module directory of your choosing) and mark the default by specifying %VER%-%REL% in the
    associated /usr/local/Modules/modulefiles/xdusage/.version file.

R7) Look at the docs/INSTALL_Testing document for a sanity-check command line to run.


**********************
** TAR Installation **
**********************

Prerequisites: sudo and these Perl modules:
  Getopt::Long *
  Date::Manip *
  JSON
  LWP::UserAgent *
  IO::Socket::SSL (do NOT use SSLeay since it doesn't check certificates)
  URI::Escape *

  * = Likely installed by default

Installation steps:

T1) Download the latest xdusage package and signature from:
    https://software.xsede.org/production/xdusage/latest/
    Verify the downloaded package against the signature

T2) Untar the package:
    tar -xzvf xdusage-%VER%-%REL%.tgz

T3) Copy xdusage-%VER%-%REL%/bin/xdusage to a directory of your choosing, <INSTALL_DIR>.
    The xdusage file should have permissions 0555, owned by root:root, so that it is not
    inadvertently changed.  DO NOT make this file owned by the xdusage user described below.

T4) Create a non-root user and dedicated group that does not map to an actual person.
    We'll refer to this user as 'xdusage' and group 'xdusage', though you can use any name you
    choose.  Generally, you'll want to set this user with: 
      shell=/dev/null 
      password disabled ('*' in the shadow file) 
      home=/

T5) Follow steps R3) thru R7) above
