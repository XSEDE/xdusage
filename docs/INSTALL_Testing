After installing the xdusage scripts as described in the INSTALL file, including
adding the appropriate accounts as admin_name declarations in xdusage.conf, 
the tester should, using her own account, run the xdusage script, and look 
for reasonable output.

===Test 1: Show tester's projects on current resource===

Steps:
   $ ./xdusage

Results:
* the output should look like the following:

one or more stanzas of:

Project: <project identifier>/<resource name> [""|status=inactive]
PI: <name of PI>
Allocation: <start date>/<end date>
 Total=<size of allocation> Remaining=<amount remaining> Usage=<how much has been used> Jobs=<number of jobs>
   <name of querying user> portal=<xsede portal name for user> usage=<personal usage> jobs=<personal number of jobs>

Notes:
* status=inactive appears on the Project: line if the project is no longer active; 
* If the project is active, no "status=" will appear


Then, from an account that is in an admin_name declaration in xdusage.conf, the 
tester should perform Test 2:

===Test 2: Query by another username===

Prerequisites:
* tester's account in admin_name declaration in xdusage.conf

Steps:
  $ env USER=<username> ./xdusage 

Results:
* Output will be as in test 1 above, but with usage information for the user specified by $USER instead of the user performing the test

Notes:
* If the test user is not in xdusage.admins, this test should give //exactly// the same output as test 1 above, for the invoking user, not the one specified by $USER

* Some connection failures may be due to the client machine not recognizing the TLS/SSL
  Certificate of the XDCDB API service.  You can confirm if that is the problem you are
  having by temporarily adding this line at the start of the gateway_submi_attributes script:
    $ENV{PERL_LWP_SSL_VERIFY_HOSTNAME} = 0;
